Key Points:
File Identification: The script uses the file command to determine the MIME type of each file, which guides the choice of the decompression command.

Supported File Types:

application/gzip → gunzip
application/x-bzip2 → bunzip2
application/zip → unzip
application/x-compress → uncompress
Verbose Mode (-v): When enabled, this mode prints messages for each file that is decompressed or skipped.

Recursive Mode (-r): When enabled, this mode recursively processes all files within directories.

Counters:

decompressed_count tracks the number of successfully decompressed files.
not_decompressed_count tracks the number of files that could not be decompressed.
Exit Status: The script exits with the number of files that were not decompressed.

Example Usage:
bash
Копировать код
./unpack.sh -r -v myfile.zip mydirectory
This command recursively decompresses myfile.zip and all files in mydirectory, with verbose output enabled.

You can easily extend the script by adding more cases in the unpack_file function to support additional file types.
